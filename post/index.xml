      <description>In quantitative finance we often look at simulations of some market risk factors like equity returns or interest rate changes.
There are many third party companies who specialize in the historical calibration of such variables and provide simulations of future expected outcomes to the companies who require them.

      <description>Welcome to my blog! I have been working in Financial Risk Management for the last 10+ years in financial instiutions for both Funds and Insurance.
For the last two years I have started to code quite regularly in R and I have now decided to open my little blog to share any insight I will get during my studying.
I will write about risk management and financial applications.
Enough talking about me…let’s start!</description>
